Documentation and Tutorials
===========================
libpointmatcher is a modular ICP library, useful for robotics and computer vision.

**Quick link for the tutorial pages: [Tutorials](doc/Tutorials.md ).**

Those tutorials are written using Markdown syntax and stored in the project's `/doc` folder.  Their scope ranges from introductory material on performing point cloud registration to instructions for the more experienced developer on how to extend the library's codebase. 

Libpointmatcher's source code is fully documented based on doxygen to provide an easy API to developers. An example of this API can be found [here](http://docs.ros.org/groovy/api/libpointmatcher/html/), but it is suggested to use the one build for your version in `doc/html`.  


libpointmatcher depends on:

 * [Eigen] version 3, a modern C++ matrix and linear-algebra library,
 * [libnabo] version 1.0.1, a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces.
 * [Doxygen], a documentation-generation tool (optional)
 
and was compiled on:
  * [Ubuntu](/doc/Compilation.md)
  * [Mac OS X](/doc/CompilationMac.md)
  * [Windows](/doc/CompilationWindows.md) (partially supported)

libpointmatcher is being developed by [François Pomerleau](mailto:f.pomerleau@gmail.com) and [Stéphane Magnenat](http://stephane.magnenat.net) as part of our work at [ASL-ETH](http://www.asl.ethz.ch).

You can read the latest changes in the [release notes](doc/ReleaseNotes.md).

Pre-built binaries
==================

Ubuntu
------

It's better to compile from the sources, but binaries for Ubuntu Linux are available on our PPA:

 * [Lucid](https://launchpad.net/~stephane.magnenat/+archive/lucid)
 * [Precise](https://launchpad.net/~stephane.magnenat/+archive/precise)
 * [Quantal](https://launchpad.net/~stephane.magnenat/+archive/quantal)
 * [Raring](https://launchpad.net/~stephane.magnenat/+archive/raring)
 
Once you have added the PPA to your system, you can install libpointmatcher using

```
sudo apt-get install libpointmatcher-dev
```

Other
-----

If you have built binaries for other systems, please tell us.

Prerequisites
-------------
If your operating system does not provide it, you must get [Eigen].
It only needs to be downloaded and extracted.
[libnabo] must be downloaded and installed, please follow the [libnabo]'s documentation to do so.


Compilation & Installation 
==========================
For beginner users who are not familiar with compiling and installing a library in Linux, go [here](doc/Compilation.md) for detailed instructions on how to compile libpointmatcher from the source code.  If you are comfortable with Linux and CMake and have already installed the prerequisites above, the following commands should install libpointmatcher on your system.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
make
sudo make install
```

Testing
=======
Libpointmatcher ships with a version of the Google testing framework [GTest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).  Unit tests are located in utest/ and are compiled with libpointmatcher.  To run the tests and make sure that your compiled version is working correctly, run the test executable in your build directory:
```
cd build
utest/utest --path ../examples/data/
```
