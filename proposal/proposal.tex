\section{Description of the project}

The project aims to map pointcloud data of outdoor city environments to \textit{OpenStreetMap}\footnote{\url{osm.org}} (OSM) building outlines.
The pointcloud data is generated by using the Structure-from-Motion technique to extract 3D data from multiple photographs taken from different viewpoints. The photographs are taken by consumer grade cameras and processed by software like VisualSFM.

To enrich the pointcloud data we want to map the facade outlines of the pointcloud to rich data that we get from OpenStreetMaps. This will allow us to identify, for example, shops and to tag different houses which might not work correctly without OSM data.

Furthermore, it is in the scope of the project to automatically extract building heights from the pointcloud data. Once the data is aligned to OSM, it will be possible to get absolute lengths from the pointcloud data. As OSM is a collaborative effort, the software might enable us to contribute back the building height data.


\section{Work packages and timeline}

The idea for matching the outlines is to break it down to a 2D problem and use the Iterative Closest Point technique to find the best match between the building outlines and the pointcloud. For that, the pointcloud will be reduced to a two dimensional pointcloud and the building outlines will be discretized to a number of points (i.e. a pointcloud will be interpolated from the polygons that are existing in OSM).
A state-of-the-art ICP, such as libpointmatcher~\cite{Pomerleau12comp} will then be used to align those two pointclouds.

Investigations will be made on how well the complexity fof OSM data can be reduced i.e., by removing holes and separations between buildings.

The first workpackage will be to use arbitrary GPS coordinates, build a simple interface to input data and automatically download an OSM file.
