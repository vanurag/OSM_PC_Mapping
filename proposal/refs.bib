   abstract    = {Recent approaches to reconstructing city-sized areas
                 from large image collections usually process them all at
                 once and only produce disconnected descriptions of image
                 subsets, which typically correspond to major landmarks.
                 In contrast, we propose a framework that lets us take
                 advantage of the available meta-data to build a single,
                 consistent description from these potentially
                 disconnected descriptions. Furthermore, this description
                 can be incrementally updated and enriched as new images
                 become avail- able. We demonstrate the power of our
                 approach by building large-scale reconstructions using
                 images of Lausanne and Prague. },
